# Code Quiz

The purpose of this project is to create a quiz about coding that implements JavaScript elements and functions that interact with the web API. Those elements and functions include forms, buttons, carousels, time counters, and score keepers among others. These were all elements that required further research into the documentation and so, through doing and studying, this project helped me broaden my understanding and fluidity with JavaScript.
